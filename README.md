# CppUtils
C++ utilities for random stuff

## Usage
Most of these utilities require at least C++11. Sometimes very basic headers (`<iostream>`, `<string>`) are required.
To use them just copy-paste it into your project and change it up a bit if it doesn't suit your needs. For `.cpp` files - you can just rename them to `.h` files, it wont affect anything.

## Licensing

ALL of these utilities are licensed under CC-BY 4.0.
